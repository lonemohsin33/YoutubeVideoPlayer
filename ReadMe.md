# YoutubeVideoPlayer
### this is a company assignment for GMI.

### this was created using create Vite
### React
i have used react as a main frontend library for the project. React allows us to create application in components which is a great advantage for developers.

### HTML/CSS
I have used old school html/css in the project. it may feel little messy due to less time for creation.

### Youtube API
Since i had to make a video player i should have the access of videos at first for that purpose. i have used YoutubeAPi to get video's from its V3 Api i have populated the components in my app.

The main page consists of Top rated videos in the country. you can click on any of the video and it will open in a new tab with bigger resolution.

the search bar is giving the results on click on the icon.

sometimes APi crashes due to completion of request per day quota. which is really bad.
